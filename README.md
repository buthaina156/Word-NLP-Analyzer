# Word-NLP-Analyzer
This project is a simple NLP application built using Python and TextBlob. It analyzes user-input words by performing spelling correction and lemmatization (base form extraction). The program continuously accepts words until the user types "quit", then displays the corrected spelling and lemma of each word.
